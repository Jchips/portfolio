      <p>I currently live in Washington, USA, but I was born in Texas. Currently, I go to a university but my goal is to become a software developer or a web developer or at least be doing something in the Computer Science field (don't quite know yet). I also LOVE dance and am a big phone geek. I love Zendaya a lot; she is pretty awesome.</p>
